# TweetEval
This is the repository for the [_TweetEval_ benchmark (Findings of EMNLP 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12421.pdf). _TweetEval_ consists of seven heterogenous tasks in Twitter, all framed as multi-class tweet classification. All tasks have been unified into the same benchmark, with each dataset presented in the same format and with fixed training, validation and test splits.

# TweetEval: The Benchmark

These are the seven datasets of TweetEval, with its corresponding labels (more details about the format in the [datasets](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweeteval/tree/main/datasets) directory):

- **Emotion Recognition**: [SemEval 2018 - Emotion Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-1001/) (Mohammad et al., 2018) - 4 labels: `anger`, `joy`,`sadness`, `optimism`

- **Emoji Prediction**, [SemEval 2018 - Emoji Prediction](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-1003.pdf) (Barbieri et al., 2018) - 20 labels: :heart:, :heart_eyes:, :joy:  `...` :evergreen_tree:, :camera:, :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

- **Irony Detection**, [SemEval 2018 - Irony Detection](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-1005.pdf) (Van Hee et al., 2018) - 2 labels: `irony`, `not irony`

- **Hate Speech Detection**, [SemEval 2019 - Hateval](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S19-2007.pdf) (Basile et al., 2019) - 2 labels: `hateful`, `not hateful`
  
- **Offensive Language Identification**, [SemEval 2019 - OffensEval](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S19-2010/) (Zampieri et al., 2019)- 2 labels: `offensive`, `not offensive`

- **Sentiment Analysis***, [SemEval 2017 - Sentiment Analysis in Twitter](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2088/) (Rosenthal et al., 2019) - 3 labels: `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`

- **Stance Detection***, [SemEval 2016 - Detecting Stance in Tweets](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S16-1003/) (Mohammad et al., 2016) - 3 labels: `favour`, `neutral`, `against`

**Note 1***: For stance there are five different target topics (Abortion, Atheism, Climate change, Feminism and Hillary Clinton), each of which contains its own training, validation and test data.

**Note 2***: The sentiment dataset has been updated as of 17 December 2020. The update has been minimal and it was intended to fix a small number of sentences that were cropped.

If you would like to have your results added to the leaderboard you can either submit a pull request or send an email to any of the paper authors with results and the predictions of your model. Please also submit a reference to a paper describing your approach.

# Evaluating your system

For evaluating your system, you simply need an individual predictions file for each of the tasks. The format of the predictions file should be the same as the output examples in the predictions folder (one output label per line as per the original test file). The predictions included as an example in this repo correspond to the best model evaluated in the paper, i.e., RoBERTa re-trained on Twitter (RoB-Rt in the paper).  

### Example usage

```bash
python evaluation_script.py
```
The script takes the TweetEval gold test labels and the predictions from the "predictions" folder by default, but you can set this to suit your needs as optional arguments.

### Optional arguments

Three optional arguments can be modified: 

*--tweeteval_path*: Path to TweetEval datasets. Default: *"./datasets/"*

*--predictions_path*: Path to predictions directory. Default: *"./predictions/"*

*--task*: Use this to get single task detailed results *(emoji|emotion|hate|irony|offensive|sentiment|stance)*. Default: ""

Evaluation script sample usage from the terminal with parameters:

```bash
python evaluation_script.py --tweeteval_path ./datasets/ --predictions_path ./predictions/ --task emoji
```
(this script would output the breakdown of the results for the emoji prediction task only)

# Pre-trained models and code

- [Twitter-RoBERTa-irony](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-irony)
- [Twitter-RoBERTa-offensive](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-offensive)
- [Twitter-RoBERTa-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment)
- Twitter-RoBERTa-stance - Coming soon

To know how to use the pre-trained models, you can check our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18cNn4cJ-bAi-Luiqi8V6c09Tj-iiX0oG), with sample code for masked language modeling, extracting embeddings from tweets and tweet classification.

**NEW!** A multilingual language model trained on Twitter for 30+ languages (XLM-T) is now available [here](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/xlm-t)

**NEWx2!** You can now test TweetEval models as part of the [TweetNLP platform](https://tweetnlp.org).
